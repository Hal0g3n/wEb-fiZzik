# Quark stars

With the idea of neutron stars already introduced, where gravity is so intense that electrons and protons fuse to form neutrons, it seems natural to ask: what if we tried more pressure?

The answer is a quark star. Contrary to the name, quark stars are not necessarily stars per se; it is hypothesised that many quark "stars" actually exist in the cores of neutron stars. Simply put, quark stars are what happens when the pressures involved are so high that even neutrons are unstable, but not so high that the neutron star collapses into a black hole.

To explain what happens now, we must introduce the idea of quarks in the first place. Quarks are, simply put, the building blocks of hadrons, a category of particles that includes protons and neutrons. In protons and neutrons, quarks are "bound" together in trios, interacting through other particles called gluons. In a proton, the trio is of two "up" quarks and 1 "down" quark. In a neutron, it's of two down quarks and an up quark. But why does this matter?

It turns out that at high enough pressures, the degeneracy pressure of neutrons is overcome. Here, neutrons are forced to dissolve, forming a hyper-dense phase of degenerate matter, comprised of tightly-packed quarks. This is referred to as quark matter, and there are two main possible forms of "stable" quark matter.

The first is referred to as a quark-gluon plasma. In this plasma, free quarks swim around in a sea of gluons. So far, scientists have created quark-gluon plasmas at extreme temperatures (300,000 times hotter than the core of the Sun), and have already found that they exhibit surprising characteristics. For instance, rather than acting like particles in a gas, quark-gluon plasmas actually flow like liquids. Still, though, we have only been able to create these plasmas on very short timescales. Furthermore, we create these quark-gluon plasmas in particle accelerators. By contrast, the cores of neutron stars are at significantly lower temperatures, and much higher pressures. As such, we do not know if quark-gluon plasmas can actually form in the cores of neutron stars.

There is another form of "stable" quark matter, however, and things get a bit stranger.

## Strange Matter

As previously mentioned, neutrons are comprised of two down quarks and an up quark. But under particularly extreme pressures and densities, when all lower energy levels are filled, a new possibility arises. Some energy can be expended to turn down quarks into more massive "strange" quarks. The introduction of these strange quarks allows for new configurations, unlocking a new set of energy levels. By accessing these new, lower, energy levels, the energy required to transmute down quarks can be recouped. Thus, the average energy of the particles decreases.

These blobs of strange matter are referred to as strangelets, and can range in size from the scale of nuclei to arbitrarily large. When they get to the size of meters, stranglets are usually referred to as strange stars. Quantum chromodynamics, or QCD, predicts strange matter is unstable on the tiniest of scales (individual particles), because of the increased mass of the strange quark. However, it also predicts that on larger scales, precisely because of the aforementioned lower energy levels that the presence of strange quarks allows for, strange matter may become more and more stable the more of it there is.

There's another aspect to strange matter, that is considerably more sinister in nature. According to the Bodmer-Terazawa-Witten hypothesis, strange matter, even outside of a neutron star, is more stable than ordinary matter. Phrased differently, all ordinary matter should slowly decay into strange matter. However, for a nucleus to form a stranglet, many down quarks would have to near-simultaneously transmute into strange quarks, so even if this hypothesis is true, we likely do not have to worry about cosmic armageddon.

## The nature of all things

So, where does this leave us? We've taken a look at the secrets of neutron stars, delved through the mechanisms of their formation, understood the principle of one Pauli and had time to chew on their doughy insides. We've also looked at the quarkier side of things, before taking a peek at the more conjectural, stranger aspects of things. And now, I am afraid that we have nearly reached the bounds of the current scientific literature. To be sure, there are other related things to explore: the Strong Force, the Nuclear Drip Line, the Electroweak Interaction, and Symmetry Breaking. But in regard to neutron stars specifically? We're back to the lab again.
