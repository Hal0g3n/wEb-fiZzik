# The Theory behind Neutron Stars

## The Principle of Certain Uncertainty

Firstly, we must appreciate Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle. The core idea of the principle is that there is no such thing as pinpoint accuracy, accurate measurements come with a trade off. More formally,

$$\Delta x \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}$$

What do the symbols mean?

- $\Delta x$ refers to the uncertainty in position, or the range of possible positions.
- $\Delta p$ refers to the uncertainty in momentum, or the range of possible momentum values.
    - $\text{Momentum} = \text{Velocity} \times \text{Mass}$
    - As mass is normally constant, the uncertainty in momentum is usually the uncertainty in velocity
- $\hbar$ is known as the Planck constant, and being a constant, is not relevant to our understanding here.

### An Experiment
Below is a video showcasing an experiment featuring the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The video will also build the intuition how Neutron Stars exploit this principle.

## Pauli and his Principle

Pauli's Exclusion principle the fundamental principle of matter, something we all encounter on a daily basis. It is the law of the universe that prevents your laptop from falling through your lap. 
In a nutshell, the principle states that two things cannot be in the same place, with the same energy, and the same spin, at the same time.
Formally, it states that two Fermions (the particles that make up most matter) cannot occupy the same quantum states. 

### An Analogy for Pauli

## The Principles at Play

In neutron stars, mere heat is insufficient to halt collapse. The particles are squeezed together, but by Pauli's Exclusion principle, they cannot merge.
The particles start physically bumping into each other locking them in place. $\Delta x$ becomes extremely small as the particles are locked in by the surrounding particles.
Here, Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle is exploited. To account for the tiny $\Delta x$, $\Delta p$ will be extremely large. This implies that the particles **can** have a large momentum.
The high momentum of the particles create an outward pressure as they headbutt one another, creating high pressure that opposes the compression of gravity.

This strong outward pressure is known as electron degeneracy pressure. Matter, such as the plasmas in neutron stars, that is stopped from being crushed mainly by degeneracy pressure is known degenerate matter.
