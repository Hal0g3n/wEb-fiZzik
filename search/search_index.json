It is the law of the universe that prevents your laptop from falling through your lap. Formally, it states that two fermions (the particles that make up most matter) cannot occupy the same quantum states. More informally, two things cannot be in the same place, at the same energy level, with the same spin, at the same time. In neutron stars, this means that when mere heat is insufficient to halt collapse, the particles physically bumping into each other halts it instead. This is called neutron degeneracy pressure. To understand it more thoroughly, we must introduce another principle: Heisenberg uncertainty. Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle Werner Heisenberg, Nobel Laureate. In addition to the principle that is his namesake, he made many other contributions to quantum mechanics, such as in the problem of plasma physics. He also participated in the effort to develop a fundamental theory of particles. Formally, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states: \\[\\Delta x \\Delta p \\ge \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\] Let's break that down. \\(\\Delta x\\) refers to the uncertainty in position, which you can think of as how many places the particle could be in. \\(\\Delta p\\) refers to the uncertainty in momentum, which you can also think of as the range of values that its momentum (velocity times mass) could take. \\(\\hbar\\) is known as the reduced Planck constant, and being a constant, is irrelevant to our understanding here. Inside Neutron Stars So how is this relevant? In neutron stars, where particles are compacted extremely close together, \\(\\Delta x\\) is very small. Correspondingly, this means that \\(\\Delta p\\) must be very large. Because of this, the average kinetic energy of the particles must be very large. (Kinetic Energy is related to momentum by \\(KE =\\frac{p^2}{2m}\\) ) We can see, then, that if high compression necessitates low position uncertainty, and low position uncertainty means high momentum, and high momentum means high energy, a tremendous amount of energy is required to squeeze neutron stars any further. This manifests itself as an outward pressure of sorts, referred to as degeneracy pressure. Matter that is stopped from being crushed mainly by degeneracy pressure, such as the plasma in neutron stars, is known as degenerate matter. References A. G. Truscott, K. E. Strecker, W. I.

If you need a refresher, neutrons, along with protons, are what make up the nuclei of atoms (\"nuclei\" are the hard centres of atoms, surrounded by fuzzy layers of electrons). But all these neutrons have to come from somewhere, and in neutron stars, that turns out to be from the combining of protons and electrons. A depiction of a helium atom. The neutrons are represented in purple, and protons in red, and together make up the central pink dot. The dark cloud surrounding the central dot represents the electron cloud of the atom. Under the incredible pressures inside neutron stars, at a certain point, compressing the same stuff into a smaller volume becomes inefficient. Instead, it's more energetically viable to compress particles together, fusing negatively charged electrons and positively charged protons together to form neutral neutrons. It's so much more viable, in fact, that as one gets deeper into a neutron star, neutrons are nearly the only things you'll find. Neutron stars are, as mentioned before, incredibly extreme, even among stars. In neutron stars, we find the strongest magnetic fields in existence, the strongest gravitational fields bar black holes, and the highest pressures known to man. They're also very hot. Despite all this, however, neutron stars aren't very bright. This might seem a little strange to you at first, because it's generally known that hotter things glow brighter. But this is where possibly the most extreme aspect of neutron stars comes in; their size. Neutron stars are tiny. The average neutron star is about 20 kilometres across. To put that in perspective, that's about the length of Manhattan, in New York. As a point of comparison, our sun, already larger than most stars in the universe, is about 1.4 million kilometres across, or 66,000 Manhattans. Consider then that volume is proportional to the cube of the radius, and we arrive at the astounding realisation that you could fit a million billion neutron stars in our sun. Rendition of a neutron star, next to Manhattan. As a consequence of this, neutron stars are unbelievably dense. Indeed, while they may only be a miniscule fraction of the volume of the Sun, the average neutron star actually weighs more than the Sun! At 1.5 solar masses, with their tiny sizes, neutron stars are the second densest objects in the universe, behind black hole singularities (with all their poorly defined density). Just a single millilitre of neutron star material would weigh as much as the combined weight of about 70% of all people alive today. The insides of neutron stars are somewhat unknown to us, and we only have theories, but those theories tell us that it probably starts out as iron, turns into spaghetti, and then becomes soup. Indeed, the scientific term for the matter in the inner crusts of neutron stars is \"nuclear pasta\". So let's dig in, shall we? References S. Walpole, D. Prieto-Merino, P. Edwards, J.

It has thickness on the order of a human hair, courtesy of the insane gravitational fields at play. While normal atmospheres are governed by factors like heat, pressure, and the like, the atmospheres that neutron stars have is quite different. The flow of these atmospheres is actually determined primarily by the tremendous magnetic fields generated by neutron stars. A hair in, we encounter the outer crust. Scientists aren't quite sure what makes up this portion of the crust, but many think that it's comprised of iron atoms crushed together into a giant, neutron-star-sized shell. Diving into the inner crust, we encounter the first type of nuclear pasta - the gnocchi phase. The gnocchi phase is, as the name would suggest, comprised of blobs. These blobs are actually nuclei that have been squished so close together that they begin to physically touch, and merge with each other. Here, the normal rules of nuclear physics, with atomic numbers and stable neutron numbers, stop applying. Go down farther, and we reach the spaghetti phase, where these blobs themselves merge with each other, forming long, tangled strands of super-nuclei. By this point, the notion of a single nucleus doesn't really apply. Past spaghetti, naturally, comes lasagna, where these strands form long, planar sheets of protons and neutrons. These sheets are massive (by molecular standards), and it is hypothesised that the largest among them reach the millimetre scale. That may not sound like much, but consider; a single neutron is about one billionth of one millionth of a meter across. Visualisations of nuclear pasta, as generated via molecular dynamics simulations. From top to bottom, nuclear lasagna, nuclear spaghetti, nuclear gnocchi, and ordinary matter. But what after lasagna? The answer, it turns out, is anti-pasta. Lasagna turns into anti-spaghetti, sheets forming hollow tubes spitting out free neutrons. Free neutrons are neutrons which are, well, free, to move through the matter that they exist as part of. Compare this to bound neutrons, which are attached to other neutrons and protons, and make up the vast majority of all neutrons in existence. Deeper still in, and anti-spaghetti forms anti-gnocchi. In this anti-gnocchi phase, our super-nuclear tubes begin to break up, parts flying off and forming hollow bubbles. Having exhausted the culinary delights, we reach the core of neutron stars. By definition, at this point, the vast majority of particles are neutrons. Neutron star cores bear similarities to the conditions the universe found itself in shortly after the big bang. Because of this, they are of great interest to researchers, as they provide a glimpse into the far past. By studying the conditions that may exist inside the cores of neutron stars, researchers are able to glean knowledge about what the early days of the universe may have been like, when everything was hot, and nothing was formed. Other than that though, we don't know for sure what the core looks like. Researchers have put forth many theories, from a neutron-degenerate superfluid (a fluid with no thickness), to a mix of neutrons and other rarer, heavier particles, such as pions and kaons. One of the most interesting, however, and possibly the weirdest, involves hyper-dense matter supported by quark-degeneracy, and a little something known as... strange matter. References M. E.

The answer is a quark star. Contrary to the name, quark stars are not necessarily stars per se; it is hypothesised that many quark \"stars\" actually exist in the cores of neutron stars. Simply put, quark stars are what happens when the pressures involved are so high that even neutrons are unstable, but not so high that the neutron star collapses into a black hole. To explain what happens now, we must introduce the idea of quarks in the first place. Quarks are, simply put, the building blocks of hadrons, a category of particles that includes protons and neutrons. In protons and neutrons, quarks are \"bound\" together in trios, interacting through other particles called gluons. In a proton, the trio is of two \"up\" quarks and 1 \"down\" quark. In a neutron, it's of two down quarks and an up quark. But why does this matter? Representation of the structure of a neutron. The colours are not relevant here, but what does matter to us is that there are two down quarks (denoted with a d) and an up quark (denoted with a u). The beige lines signify the presence of gluons, another type of fundamental particle. It turns out that at high enough pressures, the degeneracy pressure of neutrons is overcome. Here, neutrons are forced to dissolve, forming a hyper-dense phase of degenerate matter, comprised of tightly-packed quarks. This is referred to as quark matter, and there are two main possible forms of \"stable\" quark matter. The first is referred to as a quark-gluon plasma. In this plasma, free quarks swim around in a sea of gluons. So far, scientists have created quark-gluon plasmas at extreme temperatures (300,000 times hotter than the core of the Sun), and have already found that they exhibit surprising characteristics. For instance, rather than acting like particles in a gas, quark-gluon plasmas actually flow like liquids. Still, though, we have only been able to create these plasmas on very short timescales. Furthermore, we create these quark-gluon plasmas in particle accelerators. By contrast, the cores of neutron stars are at significantly lower temperatures, and much higher pressures. As such, we do not know if quark-gluon plasmas can actually form in the cores of neutron stars. There is another form of \"stable\" quark matter, and here, things get a bit stranger. References J.

But under particularly extreme pressures and densities, when all lower energy levels are filled, a new possibility arises. Some energy can be expended to turn down quarks into more massive \"strange\" quarks. The introduction of these strange quarks allows for new configurations, unlocking a new set of energy levels. By accessing these new, lower, energy levels, the energy required to transmute down quarks can be recouped. Thus, the average energy of the particles decreases. Matter that contains strange quarks is referred to as strange matter. Strange matter is generally though to form blobs, referred to as strangelets, which can range in size from the scale of nuclei to arbitrarily large. When they get to the size of meters, stranglets are usually referred to as strange stars. Quantum chromodynamics, or QCD, predicts that strange matter is unstable on the tiniest of scales (individual particles), because of the increased mass of the strange quark. However, it also predicts that on larger scales, precisely because of the aforementioned lower energy levels that the presence of strange quarks allows for, strange matter may become more and more stable the more of it there is. Order-of-magnitude illustration of the sizes of strange particles, strangelets, and strange stars. There's another aspect to strange matter, that is considerably more sinister in nature. According to the Bodmer-Terazawa-Witten hypothesis, strange matter, even outside of a neutron star, is more stable than ordinary matter. But to understand what this means, we need to understand what \"stability\" even means. \"Stability\" is a measure of something's reluctance to change. A pen balanced on its tip is very unstable, and changes readily. A stone on the ground, by contrast, is relatively stable, and does not begin rolling over of its own accord. Crucially, however, stability is relative; there is no absolute stability, merely \"more stable\" and \"less stable\". So when we say that strange matter is more stable than ordinary matter, what do we actually mean? We mean that, just like a pen balanced on its tip \"wants\" to fall down, ordinary matter \"wants\" to turn into strange matter. We mean that, past a certain point, the transition of ordinary matter into strange matter should be automatic, and indeed, unstoppable. If we follow this line of reasoning, all ordinary matter should slowly decay into strange matter, with each medium-size strangelet produced resulting in an ever-expanding strange star consuming everything in its vicinity, releasing tremendous amounts of energy in the process. However, for a nucleus to form a stable stranglet, many down quarks would have to near-simultaneously transmute into strange quarks, so even if this hypothesis is true, we likely do not have to worry about cosmic armageddon. Still, the possibility of strange matter is something that scientists are still actively looking into. References E. Witten, \"Cosmic separation of phases\", Phys. Rev.

For the sake of brevity, we chose to leave it at that. But here, we will go into what degeneracy is, why it exists, and why we care. In quantum mechanics, a system is called \"degenerate\" if it allows for multiple different configurations to give the same overall energy. That is, if you were to measure the system's energy, you would not be able to tell exactly what state it is in. This comes about because of the idea of quantum energy levels; each particle can be in a certain state, and many of these states have the same energy levels. If you've learned about orbitals in chemistry, an example of degeneracy is how the 2p subshell has three orbitals, in the x, y, and z orientations. Measuring the energy of the system does not tell you which of the 2p orbitals are filled, only that some of them are. The more filled states that have duplicate energy levels, the more degenerate something is said to be. Full degeneracy, then, is when all lower energy levels are filled. This happens when the density of particles is extremely high, i.e. in a neutron star. In the context of stars, however, degeneracy takes on a slightly different meaning. We can see that as density increases, degeneracy pressure becomes more of a factor. As such, the degree to which matter is degenerate, in this specific context, is determined by the relative contributions of degeneracy pressure and thermal pressure. Note that, as is implied here, degeneracy pressure is independent of temperature. That's all a little abstract, so let's simplify matters a bit. If something has low density (for a star) and high temperature, it's probably normal matter. If something has high density and low temperature (for a star), it's probably degenerate matter. If something has low density and low temperature, it's probably still normal matter. If something has high density and high temperature, it might be degenerate matter. The last one is less clear-cut than the others. For instance, we have examples of degenerate matter abruptly turning non-degenerate, through a sudden influx of heat. While in the main articles, we seemed to imply that only neutron stars and quark stars contain degenerate matter, this is not strictly true. In fact, scientists believe that the cores of most stars are, to a certain extent, supported by degeneracy pressure. So too is the implication that neutron stars are supported entirely by degeneracy pressure inaccurate. In reality, there's another factor at play here, and that's the strong force, which will be covered in the next appendix.","title":"On Degeneracy"},{"location":"8/","text":"There are four fundamental forces (kind of). The first is the gravitational force. The second is the electromagnetic force. The third is the weak nuclear force. And the last is the strong nuclear force. The strong nuclear force is, as one might expect, strong. At the scales where it applies, it dominates all other forces; at a distance of around a proton's radius, it overpowers electromagnetism by a factor of around 137, the weak interaction a factor of 10 \\(^6\\) , and gravity is a whopping 10 \\(^{38}\\) times weaker than the strong force. But if this is the case, then why don't we see it in day-to-day life? Well, you do, just not how you might expect. The strong force is what holds atomic nuclei together. You may have learned as a child that the nucleus of an atom consisted of positively charged protons and neutral neutrons, and wondered how that stayed together, despite electrostatic repulsion. Well, there's your answer. As for why the strong force doesn't dominate at larger scales, well, that's a little more complicated. To understand the strong force, we need to make a distinction regarding scale. When the strong force acts at the scale of around 0.8 femtometres (the insides of a proton), it is a force that is 'carried' by gluons, and binds quarks together. When it acts instead at the scale of around 1 to 3 femtometres, it's a force mediated by a category of particles known as mesons, which binds neutrons and protons together. The important thing here is that the strength of the strong force is independent of distance between pairs of quarks, but when it's between trios of quarks, such as in neutrons and protons, it stops being so. Instead, when in trios, the quarks kinds of \"cancel\" each other out. This cancellation isn't perfect, through, and what happens is that we get a very quickly decaying force that's usually called the residual strong force. This residual strong force, it turns out, is what's really keeping neutrons and protons together. And that also explains why it doesn't manifest itself obviously at the scale of our lives, like gravity does. But how does this relate to neutron stars? Well, as you can see from the graph above, it's not strictly true that the residual strong force is always attractive. At very small distances, about 0.8 femtometres (hence the above statements), the residual strong force is actually repulsive. Thus, when the neutrons in a neutron star really are compressed very densely, the repulsive effects of the residual strong force start to be significant.

The slightly longer answer is that during a star's collapse into a black hole, we know that it cannot be made of fermions, i.e. the type of particles that the Pauli exclusion principle governs. Just as the conditions of neutron stars make it favourable for protons and electrons to merge into neutrons, when they would not otherwise do so, it is predicted that during core collapse, whatever fermions exist would transform into some kinds of bosons. Bosons, since we haven't brought them up before, are the other big category of particles. You may have heard of the Higgs boson before, and that is indeed a type of boson. Similarly, gluons (which we have mentioned many times), as well as the humble photon, are also bosons. As implied above, bosons are not bound by the Pauli exclusion principle, and will happily occupy the same quantum states. This allows for gravity to finally win, and create a black hole. As for what kinds of bosons are formed, or through what mechanisms, that's still an open question. It's possible that developments in particle accelerators, breakthroughs in one of the many Grand Unified Theories (GUTs) that have been proposed over the years, or the rise of new anomalies might give us clues. But then again, we may never know. The same, though to a lesser extent, goes for strange matter as well.","title":"Overcoming Exclusion"},{"location":"Conclusion/","text":"The nature of all things So, where does this leave us?
